# Rural Renting House Project

Welcome to the Rural Renting House project! This Angular application allows users to browse and rent rural houses. The project has two main views: one with front-end only and another with an API, database, and payment methods integration. Users can also view available rental dates and switch between the views using a button in the footer.
